**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic for me this quarter was learning how a machine learning system works behind the scenes, especially how to optimize MFU (Model FLOPs Utilization). It was cool to see how small design choices can make training much faster and more efficient on real hardware.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
For my Quarter 2 Project, I would like to investigate how large-scale machine learning systems handle distributed training. In particular, I’m interested in studying different forms of parallelism—like data, tensor, or pipeline parallelism—and how they affect training speed, memory use, and overall system performance.

**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
Our Quarter 1 project has been going well, but one change I’d make is improving how often we meet in person. Instead of relying mostly on Zoom, I think meeting more regularly—maybe grabbing lunch or working together on campus—would help our group bond and collaborate even better.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
In the future, I’d like to explore different optimizers and try more experiments with training settings. There are many new optimizers, like Muon or Lion, that could improve training efficiency. Trying different configurations would help us learn how these choices affect performance and model quality in real projects.
